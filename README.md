The Gaming management is a social platform which allows users to play games and interact with other user. But, we are basically dealing with User Management module of this portal.
User Management module basically deals with User Information. 
Some basic information related to our project -
We have three categories of users -
1. Administrator (Admin)
2. Elevated User (Host)
3. Regular User (Gamer)
Every user has different permissions to access to the portal. Administrator is used to admit or decline the request of the user. He can edit the users or can delete the users.
