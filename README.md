The gaming management can be considered as a social platform for gaming community which allows users
to play games, buy games and interact with each other. The basic idea for this system is to have a database
where different users can search and purchase games at the same time. They can also review and give
ratings for the game. Moreover, the users who are allowed to use the application shall also be allowed to
interact with each other using messaging platform. Messaging will be available for users to communicate
with one another.
